# Project-SneakerOutlet

This project is a Sneaker Outlet website created in collaboration with a colleague. The project consists of five pages: a home page, pages for sneakers for men and women, a shopping basket to complete your purchase, and a return page. The last two pages utilize a form to send an email to the "warehouse" for order processing or returns.

The pages are coded in HTML5 and include elements of CSS and JavaScript.
